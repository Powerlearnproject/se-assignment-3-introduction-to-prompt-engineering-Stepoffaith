1. Prompt engineering involves designing effective prompts or instructions to control the behavior of AI models.
Task Definition**: A well-crafted prompt clearly defines the task the model should perform.
Bias Reduction**: Prompts can help mitigate bias in AI models.
Fine-Tuning**: a pre-trained model on a specific task or dataset, prompts play a crucial role in tailoring the model's behavior to the new context.
Controlled Generation

2. An essential components of a well-crafted prompt for an AI model include:
Clear Objective, Context, Examples or Guidelines, Specificity, Length.

3. Prompt tuning involves adjusting or optimizing the prompts given to an AI model in order to generate more accurate responses.
These are done through Open-ended prompts, Instructional prompts, Specific prompts, Creative prompts.
